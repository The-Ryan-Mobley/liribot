# liribot
This app utilizes node.js to allow to user to input information into the command line to find movie info, song info, or concert dates for a
band or artist. The file liri.js takes the user input then passes it along to keys.js which calls information based on user input rom either
the spotify, OMDB or the bandsintown APIs. First liri will ask 'what can I do for you?' to which you can respond with either 'spotify-this'
'movie-this', and 'concert-this'. the on the next prompt input the name of the song/artists.
